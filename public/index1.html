        <h1>White Paper</h1>
        <div class="box1a">
            <p class="p1a">How To Start?</p>
            <p class="p1b">Before you start investing, familiarize yourself first with the features.</p>
            <p class="p1c">You can participate in the HISFTM Team Project by depositing a minimum of 10 Fantom to the Fund, at which time you become eligible to receive 365% back. The 365% can be returned in four possible ways (one passive and three via marketing/invites), and when the full 365% is accumulated through any combination of these four ways, it will be necessary to reinvest or make new deposits if you wish to increase your potential income and continue receiving rewards through the protocol.</p>
            <p class="p1d">1. 5.5% Daily return on your Deposit,100% Passive.</p>
            <p class="p1e">2. 10% Direct Referral Commission for Sharing and Growing the Community Fund.</p>
            <p class="p1f">3. 5% fee for investing and withdrawing. Additional anti-whale taxes for withdrawing see 'Anti-Whale Withdrawal Taxes'. Tax for investing is paid by the contract balance. your deposit stays 1:1. Tax for withdrawing is paid from your withdrawable amount. You receive 95% of the withdrawable amount.</p>
            <p class="p1g">4. Minimum deposit to join is 10 FTM and a maximum of 5000 FTM total deposit per wallet is also implemented as an anti-whale measure.</p>
            <p class="p1h">5. Users can withdraw their payout as often as every day. It is cumulative; once 24 hours have passed, you will receive a total of 5.5% in rewards.</p>
            <p class="p1i">6. Users are given the option to Re-invest/Compound, so they do not have to withdraw their daily earnings and deposit them again in separate transactions, incurring unnecessary gas fees. In addition, at the time of reinvesting a 15% bonus is added to the amount of unwithdrawn income being compounded as an incentive to continue building the value of the project.</p>
            <p class="p1j">7. Airdrops: Users can send any amount of FTM from their wallet to users in their team or to any individual member of HISFTM.</p>
            <p class="p1k">8. Team: The first time someone uses an investor's referral link, a new team will be created with the initial investor as the team owner and their referral as a team member. From that point, any direct referrals by this initial investor become additional team members.. Upon creation of the team, the team name can be customized. There is no maximum number of members in a team.</p>

                <p class="p2b">What are the taxes inside the application ?</p>
                <p class="p2c">Withdrawal taxes in the project are scaled based on the amount of the withdrawal compared to the total amount of the contract balance.</p>
                <p class="p2d">0% tax additional if amount is < 1% of contract balance </p>
                <p class="p2e">5% additional tax if amount is >= 1% of contract balance </p>
                <p class="p2f">10% additional tax if amount is >= 2% of contract balance </p>
                <p class="p2g">15% additional tax if amount is >= 3% of contract balance</p>

                <p class="p2m">This project is the latest release of HISFTM. </p>
                <p class="p2n">HISFTM is a community-based project, 100% decentralized, P2P transactions through Smart Contract. </p>

                <p class="p2p">When 365% is received, the user will need to make a new deposit in order to increase the their max payout and continue earning passively. </p>

                <p class="p3a">ThE Onboarding System</p>
                <p class="p3b">in order to successfully make a deposit into the faucet
                    staking contract, you will first need to join someone else's team
                    by either clicking their referral link or by manually adding their
                    wallet address into the buddy referral system (minimum requirement
                    10 FTM). in order to receive referral rewards, players must hold br34p
                    in their wallet and the depth of the rewards received will be determined
                    by their individual br34p tier requirements. in addition, accounts must
                    have positive depost status for direct referral bonus rewards as well.
                    not only will you get bonuses from your downline referrals, but you
                    will also get a 2.5% deposit/compounding bonus when you deposit
                    under a "team wallet" which means someone who has 5 or more
                    direct referrals.</p>
                <p class="p3c">a rate sheet is      included below for how much br34p must be
                    held to receive 10% bonus rewards on deposits from your
                    downline. if an account is not net positive when the player in
                    their downline deposits, or if they do not hold
                    enough br34p to receive referral bonuses at that
                    level of downline or they were the last person to
                    be credited with a referral bonus from that player,
                    the bonus will go further upline until it hits a
                    player who is eligible for the referral bonuses.
                    using this round robin system we have eliminated
                    the incentive for self referring and other bad
                    behaviour which is used to leech referral
                    systems, while still greatly rewarding team
                    building through referrals!</p>
                <p class="p3d">if a player plays like a solo player, they will not get team
                    based rewards. rewards are paid as a direct deposit. this
                    will directly and immediately enhance longevity of the
                    platform and also promote long term team building. the
                    br34p tier equirements for downline referral bonus are as
                    follows...
                    </p>
                <p class="p3e">we have added a whale tax on withdrawals to help curve
                    whales ability to outpace otherplayers in the game, forcing
                    them to kick back some of their rewards to the community
                    and maintain the sustainability of the project! the tax goes
                    as follows, and does not apply to anyone below these
                    staked holdings.
                    </p>
                <p class="p3f">reservoir is the HISFTM networkâ€™s solution for
                    players that want benefit from noninflationary
                    yield farming through adding liquidity to drip.
                    players can participate by adding bnb to the reservoir
                    contract to earn passive perpetual bnb rewards, while
                    also providing locked liquidity to the drip ecosystem! bnb
                    rewards are paid out instantly and through a persisting drip protocol
                    from the dividend pool.</p>
                <p class="p3g">reservoir helps provide long-term price support and an ever rising potential price
                    floor, as permanently locked liquidity is added to the drip token on the drip network's
                    swap exchange. not only are players able to receive perpetual FTM dividends using
                    reservoir, but reservoir ensures that the floor of liquidity for HISFTM is hardened, providing
                    permanently locked liquidity and long-term price support. when you enter the reservoir
                    contract you are swapping bnb for a token called drop (bep-20) that is held by the
                    reservoir contract and represents your share of the HISFTM/FTM liquidity pool. drop will not
                    fluctuate in value and is pegged 1:1 with dripxbnb (drip's native liquidity pool token).
                    </p>
                <p class="p3h">the amount of drop held by a player determines their share of the dividends that they will
                    receive from the reservoir's instant and daily dividend pools. when you swap FTM for drop
                    and vice versa there is a 10% tax that is used to pay bnb rewards to people in the reservoir
                    and lock liquidity in the HISFTM/FTM liquidity pool. 2% of the FTM used to buy drop is
                    immediately distributed to people in the reservoir, 5% goes into the reservoir pool which
                    pays out 2% of it's balance every day to people in the reservoir, and 3% is permanently
                    locked in the drip liquidity pool! your share of the reservoir will fluctuate overtime;
                    decreasing as more drop are purchased by other players. you can always increase your
                    share by compounding or purchasing more drop.
                     </p>
                     <p class="p3i">we have also implemented a 1% fee on HISFTM/FTM swaps and this fee goes into the
                        reservoir dividend pool that is distributed daily proportional to players
                        drop holdings. this creates an additional stream of FTM into the
                        reservoir contract which is not dependent on more people
                        buying drop by entering the reservoir!</p>
                    <p class="p3j">30% additional tax if amount is >= 6% of contract balance the drip network is a complete, fully functionaland sustainable project. in the weeks followingthe launch of drip multiple development updatesare ready to be pushed which will keep excitementbuilding and give investors plenty to look

                    We removed the referral on
                    compound feature from
                    previous miners, which led to
                    massive contract draining.
